# Face-Anonymization

As we browse through the internet, we leave many pieces of information that can be used to identify or impersonate us. The project provides an overview of the most common techniques for face image anonymisation. At the same time, it evaluates six implementations of different techniques (ad-hoc and model-based) on tasks, such as naive, reverse and parrot recognition. The results of the experiment show that model-based techniques are more successful, when it comes to the providing good security preservation, while keeping decent utility of the anonymised data record.

Project was part of the [Biometric Systems](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02238) course at DTU
